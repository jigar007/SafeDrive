# SafeDriving

Note: This app is tested on Samsung Galaxy S6 edge plus.
This app requires atleast Android 5.1 Lolipop but we recommend to 7.0 Nougat.
Also recommend to use device less than 1 year old.
Mi phone has some problems with senors, so app might crash for MI phones.
Also if your phone not ask for persmission for Message and Location 
go to settings > Apps > persmissions to give permission.
